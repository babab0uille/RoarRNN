# RoarRNN
Using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) to track and analyze elephant vocalizations for wildlife monitoring and conservation by identifying patterns in acoustic signals.

## Scripts
### WaveForm(Testing).py
This script visualizes the waveform of elephant vocalizations from audio files.

### extracting2secsClips.py
This script extracts 2-second audio clips from longer files for easier analysis.

### recurrentNeuralNetwork.py
This script trains an RNN model to track and classify elephant vocalizations.
